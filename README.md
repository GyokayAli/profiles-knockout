# profiles-knockout
Knockout web app, which reads Json array from a text file and displays the data in tabular form. Retrieve, insert, update and delete all achieved with ease thanks to Knockout.

Just a simple single page app, as it was an exercise to familiarize myself with Knockout.

Great thanks to:
